### About <a id="about"></a>

There is essentially no way for a user to know which files are found in which directories on a web-server, unless the whole server has directory listing by default. However, if you go directly to the page it will be shown. So what the attacker can do is to brute force hidden files and directories. Just test a bunch of them. There are several tools for doing this. The attack is of course very noisy and will show up fast in the logs.

#### Dirb <a id="dirb"></a>

This is a really easy tool to use:

```text
dirb http://target.com
```

#### Dirbuster <a id="dirbuster"></a>

It is a GUI  
You start it with:

```text
dirbuster

wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt

file extensions=php,txt,pl,sh,asp,aspx,html,json,py,cfm,rb,cgi
```

#### OWASP ZAP <a id="owasp-zap"></a>

Insert your target.  
Add it to the context  
Click the plus-sign  
Click on Forced Browse

#### Wfuzz <a id="wfuzz"></a>

You can find the manual by typing:

```text
wfuzz -h
```

```text
wfuzz -c -z file,/root/.ZAP/fuzzers/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-big.txt --sc 200 http://pegasus.dev:8088/FUZZ.php
```

#### Gobuster <a id="gobuster"></a>

```text
# Gobuster - remove relevant responde codes (403 for example)
gobuster -u http://192.168.1.101 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web_Content/common.txt -s '200,204,301,302,307,403,500' -e

note: to append a forward slash to each item in wordlist, use -f
note2: another good list is /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-1.0.txt
```

### WAF - Web application firewall <a id="waf---web-application-firewall"></a>

It might be that dirb shows you 403 errors, instead of the expected 404. This might mean that there is a WAF protecting the site. To get around it we might have to change our request header to it looks more like a normal request.

```text
dirb http://target.com -a "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/51.0.2704.106 Safari/537.36"
