# Introduction

This gitbook will serve as my complete pentest cheatsheet. I try to make it a habit to insert new stuff as soon as i learn. I've tried to catagorize everything naturally, but we all know that's not as easy. Some stuff might occur on several instances. If you want to make a contribution or become a member of the project, contact me.

A lot of these techniques are stuff that I have used on different CTF's and mostly hackthebox. 

This is heavily inspired by xapax and you can read his book on [https://xapax.gitbooks.io/security/content/](https://xapax.gitbooks.io/security/content/).
